#### 2.1 Base Pricing Calculator

```
Monthly Subscription Price = (Base Price per Location) × (Number of Locations) × (Tier Discount) × (Volume Discount) × (Term Discount)

Where:
├─ Base Price per Location: Tier-specific ($50-$150)
├─ Tier Discount: Based on location count (0.67x - 1.0x)
├─ Volume Discount: Additional discount for 50+ locations (0-15%)
├─ Term Discount: Annual pre-pay discount (10%)
└─ Multi-Brand Discount: Multiple brands (15%)
```

**Example Calculations:**

**Example 1: Small Franchisor (12 locations)**
```
Base Price: $150/location/month (Starter Tier)
Locations: 12
Tier Discount: 1.0x (Starter)
Volume Discount: 0% (< 50 locations)
Term Discount: 0% (monthly billing)

Monthly Cost = $150 × 12 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = $1,800/month
Annual Cost = $1,800 × 12 = $21,600/year

With Annual Pre-Pay:
Annual Cost = $21,600 × 0.90 = $19,440/year (save $2,160)
```

**Example 2: Mid-Size Franchisor (45 locations)**
```
Base Price: $100/location/month (Growth Tier)
Locations: 45
Tier Discount: 0.67x (Growth)
Volume Discount: 0% (< 50 locations)
Term Discount: 10% (annual pre-pay)

Monthly Cost = $100 × 45 × 1.0 × 1.0 = $4,500/month
Annual Cost = $4,500 × 12 = $54,000/year

With Annual Pre-Pay:
Annual Cost = $54,000 × 0.90 = $48,600/year (save $5,400)
```

**Example 3: Large Franchisor (150 locations)**
```
Base Price: $75/location/month (Enterprise Tier, negotiated)
Locations: 150
Tier Discount: 0.5x (Enterprise)
Volume Discount: 10% (100+ locations)
Term Discount: 10% (annual pre-pay)

Monthly Cost = $75 × 150 × 1.0 × 0.90 = $10,125/month
Annual Cost = $10,125 × 12 = $121,500/year

With Annual Pre-Pay:
Annual Cost = $121,500 × 0.90 = $109,350/year (save $12,150)
```

**Example with Stacking:**

├─ Volume discount (10%): $7,500 × 0.90 = $6,750/month
├─ Multi-year (15%): $6,750 × 0.85 = $5,737.50/month
└─ Annual pre-pay (10%): $5,737.50 × 0.90 = $5,163.75/month

Total: $5,163.75/month = $61,965/year per year (2-year commitment)
Effective rate: $68.85/location/month (31.2% total discount)
```

### 3. Revenue Recognition Policy

#### 3.1 Revenue Recognition Principles (ASC 606)

**5-Step Model:**

```
1. IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT
   ├─ Signed agreement (electronic or written)
   ├─ Payment terms specified
   └─ Commercial substance

2. IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
   ├─ Software subscription service (monthly/annual)
   ├─ Onboarding and implementation services
   ├─ Professional services (if applicable)
   └─ Support and maintenance (included in subscription)

3. DETERMINE TRANSACTION PRICE
   ├─ Total contract value (TCV)
   ├─ Adjust for discounts and variable consideration
   └─ Exclude sales taxes

4. ALLOCATE PRICE TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
   ├─ Subscription: Monthly or ratably over contract term
   ├─ Onboarding: Upfront (one-time service)
   ├─ Professional services: As services rendered
   └─ Allocate based on standalone selling prices

5. RECOGNIZE REVENUE
   ├─ Subscription: Ratably over time (monthly/annual term)
   ├─ Onboarding: Upon completion of onboarding
   ├─ Professional services: As work is performed
   └─ Support: Included in subscription (not separate)
```

**Expansion Triggers:**

```yaml
Expansion Trigger: High Usage
  Indicator: Daily active users > 90%
  Action: CSM proposes additional modules or tier upgrade
  Timing: 90 days post-onboarding
  Expected uplift: +20-30% MRR

Expansion Trigger: New Locations Opened
  Indicator: Customer opens new franchise locations
  Action: Auto-email offering to add locations to subscription
  Timing: Within 7 days of location launch (monitor news/socials)
  Expected uplift: $100-150/location/month

Expansion Trigger: Feature Request
  Indicator: Customer requests feature in higher tier
  Action: CSM demos higher tier capabilities
  Timing: Real-time when request received
  Expected uplift: +30-100% MRR (tier upgrade)

Expansion Trigger: QBR Performance Review
  Indicator: Quarterly business review shows ROI
  Action: Discuss expansion based on demonstrated value
  Timing: 90, 180, 270 days post-onboarding

  Indicator: Customer manages multiple franchise brands
  Action: Offer multi-brand management add-on
  Timing: 6+ months post-onboarding
  Expected uplift: +$2,000/month
```

---

#### 1.2 Pricing Optimization Tactics

**Strategy 1: Good-Better-Best Tier Positioning**

```
Current Problem: Too many customers in Starter tier (low ARPA)

Solution: Reposition tiers to push customers to Growth tier

Before (Current):
├─ Starter: 5-20 locations @ $150/loc
├─ Growth: 21-100 locations @ $100/loc
└─ Enterprise: 100+ locations @ $50-75/loc

After (Optimized):
├─ Starter: 5-10 locations @ $175/loc (increase price, reduce range)
├─ Growth: 11-100 locations @ $110/loc (start sooner, slight increase)
└─ Enterprise: 100+ locations @ $60-80/loc (increase floor)

Impact:
├─ Push 11-20 location customers to Growth (higher tier)
├─ Increase revenue from small customers
└─ Expected ARPA increase: +12%
```

---

**Strategy 2: Usage-Based Pricing Add-Ons**

```
Add-On: Transaction Volume Tier
  Base plan includes: Up to 50,000 transactions/month
  Overage pricing: $0.10 per transaction above limit
  Target: High-volume POS customers
  Expected adoption: 15% of customers
  Revenue impact: +$150-500/customer/month

Add-On: Storage Tier
  Base plan includes: 50GB storage
  Additional storage: $50/50GB/month
  Target: Customers with heavy media usage (auditing photos/videos)
  Expected adoption: 20% of customers
  Revenue impact: +$50-150/customer/month

Add-On: API Call Limits
  Base plan includes: 10,000 API calls/month (Growth tier only)
  Additional calls: $100/10,000 calls/month
  Target: Customers with heavy integrations
  Expected adoption: 10% of Growth/Enterprise customers
  Revenue impact: +$100-300/customer/month
```

### 2. Churn Reduction Strategies

def calculate_health_score(customer):
    """
    Calculate customer health score (0-100)
    Weighted average of multiple factors
    """

    # Usage (40% weight)
    usage_score = (
        (customer.daily_active_users / customer.total_users) * 40 +
        (customer.features_adopted / total_features) * 30 +
        (customer.login_frequency / 30) * 30  # logins per month
    ) * 0.4

    # Engagement (25% weight)
    engagement_score = (
        (customer.support_tickets_resolved / max(customer.support_tickets, 1)) * 40 +
        (1 if customer.attended_qbr else 0) * 30 +
        (customer.nps_score / 10) * 30
    ) * 0.25

    # Financial (20% weight)
    financial_score = (
        (1 if customer.payment_current else 0) * 50 +
        (customer.expansion_revenue / customer.base_revenue) * 50
    ) * 0.20

    # Product feedback (15% weight)
    feedback_score = (
        (customer.feature_requests / 10) * 40 +  # max 10
        (customer.positive_feedback / max(customer.total_feedback, 1)) * 60
    ) * 0.15

    health_score = usage_score + engagement_score + financial_score + feedback_score

    return min(100, max(0, health_score))
```

---

#### 2.2 Win-Back Campaign

**Churned Customer Re-Engagement:**

```
Phase 1: Immediate (Days 1-30 post-churn)
├─ Exit interview to understand reasons
├─ Send "Sorry to see you go" email
├─ Offer to export data
└─ Add to win-back nurture sequence

Phase 2: Short-Term Win-Back (Months 1-3)
├─ Month 1: Email showcasing new features released since they left
├─ Month 2: Share success story from similar customer
├─ Month 3: Offer "We want you back" discount (20% off 3 months)

Phase 3: Long-Term Nurture (Months 4-12)
├─ Quarterly email with product updates
├─ Invite to webinars and events
├─ Industry insights and benchmarking reports
└─ Annual "check-in" call from CSM

Success Metrics:
├─ Win-back rate target: 15% within 12 months

### 3. Pricing Power & Monetization

#### 3.1 Value Metric Evolution

**Current: Per-Location Pricing**
- Pros: Simple, easy to understand, scales with customer growth
- Cons: Doesn't capture usage variance, high-usage customers underpay

**Future: Hybrid Pricing Model (Year 3+)**

```
Base Subscription (Per Location)
  └─ $75/location/month

Plus Usage-Based Components:
├─ Transactions: $0.05 per transaction (above 10K/month included)
├─ Users: $20/user/month (5 users per location included)
├─ Storage: $40/50GB/month (25GB per location included)
└─ API Calls: $0.01 per call (1K/month included)

Example Customer (50 locations, high usage):
├─ Base: 50 × $75 = $3,750/month
├─ Transactions: 800K @ $0.05 = $2,500/month (overages above 500K)
├─ Users: 300 users - 250 included = 50 × $20 = $1,000/month
├─ Storage: 200GB - 1,250GB included = 0 (within limit)
├─ API: 50K calls - 50K included = 0 (within limit)
└─ Total: $7,250/month (vs. $5,000 with pure per-location)

Benefits:
├─ Fair: Heavy users pay more
├─ Growth alignment: Revenue grows with customer usage
├─ Predictability: Base fee provides revenue floor
└─ Expansion: Automatic revenue growth without sales touchpoint
