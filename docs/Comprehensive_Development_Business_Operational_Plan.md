### 2. Technology Stack Rationale

#### Backend: Rust + Axum
**Advantages:**
- **Performance**: Near C-level performance for high-throughput operations
- **Memory Safety**: Prevents common security vulnerabilities
- **Concurrency**: Excellent support for concurrent requests
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error checking reduces runtime issues
- **Ecosystem**: Growing ecosystem with strong database and web frameworks

**Trade-offs:**
- Steeper learning curve for developers
- Smaller talent pool compared to Node.js/Python
- Longer initial development time

**Decision**: Justified for a platform requiring high performance, reliability, and security for potentially thousands of franchise locations.

#### Frontend: React + TypeScript
**Advantages:**
- **Component Reusability**: Shared components across web and mobile (React Native)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches errors at compile-time
- **Large Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries and tools
- **Developer Availability**: Large talent pool
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM for efficient updates

#### Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS
**Advantages:**
- **Reliability**: ACID compliance, proven at scale
- **Geo-location**: Native support via PostGIS extension
- **JSON Support**: Flexible data structures when needed
- **Advanced Features**: Window functions, CTEs, full-text search
- **Open Source**: No licensing costs

#### Mobile: React Native
**Advantages:**
- **Code Sharing**: 70-80% code reuse between iOS and Android
- **Hot Reloading**: Faster development cycles
- **Native Performance**: Close to native app performance
- **Cost Effective**: Single codebase for multiple platforms

**Roles:**
- Product Owner: Prioritizes backlog, defines acceptance criteria
- Scrum Master: Facilitates ceremonies, removes blockers
- Development Team: Self-organizing, cross-functional

#### Code Quality Standards

**Code Review Process:**
1. All code must be reviewed by at least one senior developer
2. Automated checks must pass (linting, tests, security scans)
3. PR description must include:
   - What: Brief description of changes
   - Why: Rationale for changes
   - How: Technical approach
   - Testing: How changes were tested
4. Maximum PR size: 400 lines changed (excluding tests)
5. Review SLA: 24 hours for feedback

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints tested
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows automated
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for key operations
- **Security Tests**: OWASP Top 10 automated scanning

**Code Style:**
- Rust: `rustfmt` and `clippy` enforced in CI
- TypeScript: ESLint with Airbnb config
- Commit messages: Conventional Commits specification
- Branch naming: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/` prefixes

#### CI/CD Pipeline

## Risk Management

### 1. Key Risks and Mitigation Strategies

#### Risk 1: Development Delays

**Description:** MVP or subsequent releases delayed due to technical complexity, scope creep, or resource constraints

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Overall Risk:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Strict scope management for MVP (ruthlessly prioritize)
- Agile methodology with 2-week sprints for early feedback
- Buffer time built into timeline (20% contingency)
- Regular progress reviews and course corrections
- Technical spikes to de-risk complex features early

**Contingency:**
- If 2+ weeks behind: Re-prioritize features, cut non-essentials
- If 4+ weeks behind: Delay launch, communicate to stakeholders
- Consider augmenting team with contractors

---

#### Risk 2: Low Customer Adoption / Poor Product-Market Fit

**Description:** Customers don't see value, low usage, high churn

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Critical
**Overall Risk:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Extensive customer discovery before development
- Pilot program with 3-5 design partners for feedback
- Continuous user research and feedback loops
- Data-driven product decisions (analytics on feature usage)
- Customer advisory board for strategic input

**Contingency:**
- If churn > 20% in first year: Conduct exit interviews, pivot features
- If usage low: Enhance onboarding, add in-app guidance
- If feedback negative: Rapid iteration based on feedback

---

#### Risk 3: Security Breach or Data Loss

**Description:** Unauthorized access, data leak, ransomware attack

**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Critical
**Overall Risk:** Medium-High

**Mitigation:**
- Security-first architecture (encryption, RBAC, secure coding)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Employee security training
- Incident response plan documented and tested
- Cyber insurance coverage

**Contingency:**
- Activate incident response plan
- Engage security firm for forensics
- Transparent communication with affected customers
- Offer credit monitoring services if PII compromised
- Regulatory reporting as required

---

#### Risk 4: Competitive Response

**Description:** Incumbent competitors lower prices or release similar features

**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** Medium
**Overall Risk:** Medium-High

**Mitigation:**
- Differentiate on user experience and customer service, not just features
- Continuous innovation and fast release cadence
- Build strong customer relationships (high switching costs)
- Focus on underserved mid-market segment
- Maintain cost efficiency to allow price flexibility

**Contingency:**
- If competitor lowers price: Emphasize value and ROI, consider matching for at-risk customers
- If competitor launches similar features: Accelerate roadmap, highlight unique advantages
- If losing deals: Conduct win/loss analysis, adjust positioning

---

#### Risk 5: Key Personnel Turnover

**Description:** Loss of critical team members (founders, lead engineers, key sales)

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Overall Risk:** Medium-High

**Mitigation:**
- Competitive compensation (salary + equity)
- Positive company culture and work-life balance
- Career growth opportunities
- Knowledge sharing and documentation (no single point of failure)
- Vesting schedules to incentivize retention

**Contingency:**
- Cross-train team members on critical systems
- Maintain relationships with recruiters for quick backfills
- Offer counter-offers or retention bonuses for critical roles
- Knowledge transfer period before departures

---

#### Risk 6: Insufficient Funding / Burn Rate Too High

**Description:** Run out of cash before achieving profitability or next funding round

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** Critical
**Overall Risk:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Conservative financial planning with 6-month runway buffer
- Monthly financial reviews and forecasting
- Milestone-based hiring (don't hire ahead of revenue)
- Monitor burn rate and extend runway as needed
- Diversify revenue (different customer sizes and industries)

**Contingency:**
- If runway < 9 months: Cut discretionary spending, delay non-essential hires
- If runway < 6 months: Initiate fundraising process, explore bridge financing
- If runway < 3 months: Consider strategic alternatives (acquisition, down round)

---
