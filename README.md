## Technology Stack

LazyFranchisor is built with a modern, high-performance, and scalable technology stack:

### Backend (MVP Server)

*   **Language:** Rust
*   **Web Framework:** Axum (for high performance, memory safety, and concurrency)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension (for robust relational data and advanced geographical queries)
*   **ORM/Database Access:** `sqlx` (asynchronous, compile-time checked SQL queries)
*   **Caching/Messaging:** Redis
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
*   **Containerization:** Docker (for consistent deployment and environment management)

### Frontend (Multi-Platform)

*   **Web Application:** React with TypeScript
*   **Mobile Application:** React Native with TypeScript (for iOS and Android, maximizing code reuse)
*   **Desktop Application:** Electron (packaging the web application for dedicated desktop use)

## Architecture Overview

LazyFranchisor adopts a microservices-oriented architecture, where different functionalities (e.g., Accounting, Warehouse, POS) are developed and deployed as independent services. All components are containerized using Docker, ensuring portability and scalability.

The multi-platform frontend applications (Web, Mobile, Desktop) interact with the Rust backend via RESTful APIs, secured with JWT-based authentication.

## Getting Started (Local Development Setup)

To set up LazyFranchisor for local development, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

*   **Rust:** Install `rustup` from [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/)
*   **Node.js & npm/Yarn:** Install Node.js (LTS version)
*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** Install Docker Desktop from [https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
*   **Git:** Install Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lohnxongmixay/LazyFranchisor.git
    cd LazyFranchisor
    ```

2.  **Start Backend Services with Docker Compose:**
    Navigate to the `docker` directory and bring up the database, Redis, and backend services:
    ```bash
    cd docker
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```
    This will start PostgreSQL (with PostGIS), Redis, and the Rust backend.

3.  **Run Backend Database Migrations:**
    Once the database is running, apply the necessary migrations for the backend:
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    # Ensure sqlx-cli is installed: cargo install sqlx-cli
    sqlx migrate run
    ```

4.  **Setup and Run Frontend Applications:**

    *   **Web Application:**
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend/web
        npm install # or yarn install
        npm start   # or yarn start
        ```

    *   **Mobile Application:**
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend/mobile
        npm install # or yarn install
        # Follow React Native environment setup for iOS/Android: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
        npm start   # or yarn start
        ```

    *   **Desktop Application:**
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend/desktop
        npm install # or yarn install
        npm start   # or yarn start
        ```
